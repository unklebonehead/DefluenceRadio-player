        <h2>About Defluenced Radio!</h2></br><br>
        <p>The ultimate goal of Defluenced Radio is to provide the best in Edu-tainment and to help provide a pathway into the world of Web3 that is easy, fun and affordable for everyone.</p>
        <p>Stick around and listen while you're at work or at play. Keep it on all night & all day. We dont want to influence you. We want to defluence you into the next form of the web. Where <strong>you</strong> are in control and not some large corporation.</P>,br></br>
        <h2>Some back story</h2><br></br>
        <p>The Defluenced Podcast (hosted by Unkle Bonehead & Allen Taylor is what inspired this site and the mission it is currently on. While it has taken several
          forms already over the last year, I think we have finally settled on a look and feel. The URL is the way it is because I am planning on doing a lot of articles and pages to help onboard as many people to real-world Web3 that works.</p>

        <p>Right now in 2023, there is only one that works as advertised, and it has a plethora of apps already built and operating right now. These apps span the gamut from social media, multimedia, and games.</p>

        <p>In Web3 <strong>you</strong> have complete control over what you post. <strong>You</strong> retain ownership of <strong>all</strong> of what you post. There is no board of directors, no CEO, and no way to delete you or your content. You
          don't have to post your content to 10 different sites to be seen. You have a log in. You have an identity, and it gets you everywhere. All of this is powered by Hive.</p>

        <p>Thousands of us are there already, and you are more than welcome to come join us.</p>

        <p>Feel free to contact me either by email or the old social media, and I will help in any way I can.</p>
